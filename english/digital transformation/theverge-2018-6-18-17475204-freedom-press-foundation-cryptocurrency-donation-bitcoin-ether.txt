 The Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) now accepts donations in multiple cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin, and zcash. To mark its first major cryptocurrency gift, on Monday, the nonprofit accepted a 1,000-ether donation from Mainframe, a decentralized network for censorship resistance. Mainframe is known for its antics back in March, when it avoided regulatory scrutiny over initial coin offerings by giving away its new coin for free at a party. The foundation has technically accepted bitcoin since 2013, but the Stripe integration for bitcoin was often broken. In January, after Stripe removed support for bitcoin, the FPF stopped accepting bitcoin as well. With the new announcement today, the FPF is also launching a new page that accepts cryptocurrencies directly from digital wallets. A HUGE thank you to @Mainframe_HQ, who is helping kick off our cryptocurrency donation page with a donation of 1000 ETH! We are thrilled @Mainframe_HQ shares our goal of protecting journalists and whistleblowers in the digital age. https://t.co/P8q6aEZJ14 Accepting cryptocurrency donations has been an alternative to traditional payment platforms like PayPal or Stripe that might be subject to more regulation. For instance, in 2010, PayPal suspended donations to WikiLeaks, citing a violation to its acceptable use policy.
