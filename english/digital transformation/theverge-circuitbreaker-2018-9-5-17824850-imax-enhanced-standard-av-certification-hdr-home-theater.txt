 IMAX announced today that it’s launching a new certification program called IMAX Enhanced that it’s developed along with audio and surround sound specialist DTS. The idea is that qualifying televisions, projectors, A/V receivers, sound systems, and other home theater equipment should provide the best 4K / HDR images and sound quality, in IMAX’s opinion.  The company doesn’t get specific about what qualifiers it considers before certifying a device, but it did say that they “meet a carefully prescribed set of the highest audio and video performance standards, set by a certification committee of IMAX and DTS engineers and Hollywood’s leading technical specialists.” The program will launch this fall with its initial partners — Sony, Denon, Marantz, Sony Pictures, and Paramount. The company also says it’ll release IMAX Enhanced content, starting out with movies digitally remastered in partnership with studios, that will be optimized for your home theater setup and in accordance with the original filmmaker’s desired specifications. (IMAX is calling that optimization “IMAX Mode.”) Essentially, it sounds like IMAX wants some of Dolby’s territory with its Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos standards. IMAX could define its idea of what post-production work creates the best image while DTS considers sound.
