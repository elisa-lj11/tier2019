 These sculptures by artist Jonty Hurwitz may not look like much more than twisted hunks of metal, but that's only until you see their reflections in a cylinder-shaped mirror. Using a series of algorithms, Hurwitzis carefully distorts 3D scans of objects digitally, before then fabricating the sculpture. The result is a piece of metal that only reveals its true shape when you see its reflection â€” whether it's a frog or a floating hand. It takes more than math and processing power to get them to look just right, though. "There is also a lot of hand manipulation to make it all work properly, too," Hurwitz tells Colossal, "as spacial transformations have a subtle sweet spot which can only be found by eye."
