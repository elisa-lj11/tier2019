 Bethesda announced two virtual reality spinoffs at its E3 press conference this evening, including one for its survival sci-fi horror game Prey and the Nazi-killing extravaganza Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus.  Typhon Hunter is a competitive game mode for Prey that pits you against the game’s crafty shape-shifting alien combatants in what’s described as a “deadly game of cat and mouse, except in this instance the cat is sometimes a trashcan or a bottle of cleaning supplies and the mouse has a shotgun.” The mode will be available both in VR and in standard 2D, and it’s being bundled with the game’s upcoming Mooncrash expansion coming out later this summer. (You can also get your hands on Typhon Hunter in the new Prey digital deluxe edition.)  You asked, we listened. Story Mode, Survival Mode, and New Game+ are available now in a free update to #Prey. #BE3https://t.co/DzKvEVP7uy pic.twitter.com/oaYNDbGUvf Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot is a new VR experience set in the series’s revisionist history universe where you’ll control a fire-breathing Panzerhund, the game’s fearsome Nazi robotic hounds, as you fight help the French resistance fight off the Germans in Paris. Unlike Typhon Hunter, Cyberpilot is a standalone game and looks to be VR-only.
