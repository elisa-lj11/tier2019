 Oppo Digital, the 14-year-old US brand known for its high-end audio equipment and disc players, says it has begun winding down its business. From April 2nd, Oppo Digital says it will “gradually” stop making products like the PM3 headphones, and DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K UHD disc players.

Those who have bought an Oppo Digital product in the past 30 days are eligible for a refund.
