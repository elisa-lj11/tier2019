 WWDC 2018 is here, and Apple will be taking the stage at the San Jose Convention Center later this morning to kick things off with its big keynote address, presumably to present updates on the future of iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and the rest of the software that drives all of Apple’s products.  If you’re a developer (or you’re just interested in a deeper dive into the inner workings of the software behind your iPhone or Mac), the fun doesn’t stop with just the keynote presentation today. Apple will be hosting sessions the entire week on almost every aspect of building software for its products — including, no doubt, a closer look at the soon to be announced iOS 12 and macOS 10.14.  It’s pretty much a given that Apple will be showing off iOS 12 — said to include a new focus on “digital health” and how much you use your devices, along with new AR features and macOS 10.14, which may offer new cross-platform iOS compatibility of some kind. As for the rest? We’ll just have to wait and see what Apple has up its sleeves.
