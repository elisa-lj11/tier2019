 Last year, Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment announced they were launching a new digital streaming platform that would include both animated and live action series. Now, that service has a name — DC Universe — and an official landing page on the DC Comics website.  The landing page describes the platform as a “first-of-its kind, immersive digital experience designed just for DC fans,” with access to exclusive original series. Several shows have already been announced for the platform, including the animated Young Justice: Outsiders, the live-action adaptation of DC’s Titans comics, and an animated series focusing on fan favorite Harley Quinn. Today it was also announced that a live-action Swamp Thing series would be coming to the service.  The ultimate DC membership is coming, thanks to @TheDCUniverse.

Greg Berlanti (Arrow, The Flash) will write and produce the Titans series alongside Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind). While DC Universe doesn’t have a launch date yet, Titans is expected to premiere sometime in 2018, with Swamp Thing targeted for a 2019 release.
