 It looks like Apple has some big changes in store for the Apple Watch. 9to5Mac seems to have caught an early video stream from Apple that revealed the design of the Apple Watch Series 4, and it looks to have the largest change to date. The Watch’s screen now appears to go nearly edge-to-edge, and the body of the watch seems to be thinner. The larger screen means there’s now room to show even more information, and there appears to be nine complications visible on the new watch face. It’s a ton to look at on a small screen, but the watch’s strength is in glanceable information. Apple has also seems to have tweaked how it denotes an LTE watch: rather than filling the digital crown with a red dot, it now just features a red ring, which is much subtler. 9to5Mac also spotted what appears to be an additional microphone hole on the right side of the watch and pointed out that the button beneath the crown appears to be more flush with the body of the watch than before. And while the design seems to be slimming down, it looks like the Watch will still be compatible with prior bands. The new Watch should be announced next month, on September 12th. Apple just today sent out invitations to an event that day, where it’s expected to announce three new iPhones and potentially updated iPads, too. 9to5Mac also caught sight of two of the new iPhones, which appear to be called the iPhone XS.
