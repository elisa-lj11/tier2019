 Image-Line has just released the newest version of its Digital Audio Workstation FL Studio (Fruity Loops), and with it comes native Mac support for the first time since its creation in 1997, as reported by Pitchfork. Although the ability to use the program on Mac is the biggest news, FL Studio 20 also includes other updates. This version has support for time signatures, freezing for clips in order to free up CPU, and the ability to have multiple “arrangements” so users can work with different versions of a project at one time. The program is affordable in comparison to some other DAWs, and it has gained many prolific fans, like Martin Garrix, Metro Boomin, and Porter Robinson. The company initially said it had begun working on a Mac version back in 2013. It then released a version in 2014, which never moved beyond testing. The reason for the DAW’s delay in moving over to Mac was due to Delphi, the programming language used, which used to be more suited for Windows. If you buy FL Studio, the license covers both Mac and Windows. Current FL Studio owners can download the Mac version for no additional charge, and projects are compatible between the Mac and Windows versions of the program. You can get the most basic version of the program for $99, while the beefed-up FL Studio goes for $899 and includes a host of VSTs (only some of which, it should be noted, are cross-compatible with Mac).
