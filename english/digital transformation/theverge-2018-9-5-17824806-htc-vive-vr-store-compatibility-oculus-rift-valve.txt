 HTC and Valve have opened the Vive virtual reality headset’s digital store to its biggest competitor. That means Oculus Rift users who play games on the Facebook-owned headset can now start buying and downloading games and apps from HTC’s Viveport store.  Oculus Rift users might already have options like Steam and Oculus’ own store to shop from, but at least the new compatibility gives users more options to surf through and places to do comparison shopping. Still, most of the titles carried in Viveport aren’t compatible with Oculus Rift headsets. Out of 1,400 titles, only around 200 are confirmed to be compatible with Oculus headsets. There’s also a subscription service component to Viveport, which HTC launched last year, that gives users access to unlimited games and apps in exchange for a monthly fee. The three-month plan currently costs $19.99, the six-month plan costs $39.99, and the 12-month plan costs $79.99. HTC is running a promotion until September 16th, giving customers certain titles like Shooty Fruity and Final Soccer VR to keep permanently, depending on which plan you choose.
