 It looks like Lexar is back on its feet.  Back in 2017, the staple company in the world of digital storage threw in the towel and announced that it’d be ceasing retail operations that year. But according to an announcement spotted by CameraJabber earlier this week, the company is back in business, and will be ready to return to producing and globally shipping flash storage as of this fall.  “I’m extremely excited to re-introduce the Lexar brand to our worldwide customers,” Lexar CEO Huabo Cai said in a statement. “Lexar is dynamic, has superior research and development capabilities, and has a deep understanding of our customer’s needs. At the same time, we are confident that we can expand the Lexar business successfully in different markets globally.” This is the first news that we’re hearing from Lexar since it was acquired by a new parent company, Longsys, after Micron shut down the brand in June of 2017. Right now, there’s no clear details about whether there will be any changes to the company’s product lineup, which included a wide array of memory cads, card readers, SSDs, and USB flash drives.
