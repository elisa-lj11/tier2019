 Walmart announced its website was getting an overhaul back in April, and today, it will begin to roll out its new fashion shopping experience, divided into Walmart’s Everyday Brands and Premium Brands from Lord & Taylor for more expensive items. When available, people should see these two different categories on Walmart’s website within the fashion section. The premium section will include 125 brands, including Lucky Brand, H Halston, and Effy, while the everyday section will be “part of Walmart.com’s broader fashion destination” and also include items like watches and luggage. Walmart’s newly redesigned website not only features a cleaner, sleeker design (as seen in the screencap from the fashion section) but personalization for the person browsing it as well as “specialty shopping experiences” that create visual narratives around brands and categories of products. For example, under “Sports & Outdoors” there are click-through visuals for “get the jump on family fun” (trampolines), and “go from couch potato to fitness pro.” As far as Walmart’s foray into creating online clothing boutiques, it’s a common tactic used by other fashion marketplaces, and it makes sense, especially since Walmart’s digital arm already sells high-end names like Tory Burch and Coach. Though, it seems getting people to believe Walmart can be premium is still an issue as when Googling “tory burch walmart” the first suggested phrase is “why is walmart selling tory burch?” The new Premium Brands from Lord & Taylor section should be available on Walmart.com within the next few weeks, and orders over $35 will be eligible for free two-day shipping.
