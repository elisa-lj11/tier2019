 At its Sunday night press conference, Devolver Digital made a delightfully unexpected announcement: the cult classic game Metal Wolf Chaos is finally coming to America later this year on PC, XBox One, and PlayStation 4. Created by FromSoftware, the studio behind Dark Souls and Bloodborne, Metal Wolf Chaos was originally available on Xbox in Japan back in 2004, but was never released in the West. Set in the future, the third-person shooter revolves around the mech-suited 47th president of the United States, who must battle his equally mech-suited evil vice president for control of the country after a coup dâ€™etat.  The updated version, Metal Wolf Chaos XD, will feature a widescreen version and updated visuals so that players can enjoy robo-punching people in space as the president in even crisper detail.
