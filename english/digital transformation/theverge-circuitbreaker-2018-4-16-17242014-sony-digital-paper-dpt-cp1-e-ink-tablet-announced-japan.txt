 The selling point of Sony’s DPT-RP1 “Digital Paper” tablet is right there in the name: it’s basically a giant slab of E Ink the same size as a sheet of A4 paper, and it works with a stylus for document creation, PDF annotation, and so on. Now, Sony’s announced a new version. the DPT-CP1, which is basically the exact same thing but in A5 size.  The 10.3-inch screen has a resolution of 1404 x 1872 at 224 dots per inch and is capable of 16 levels of greyscale. The DPT-CP1 has 16GB of storage for PDF files, which can be shared with iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac devices through a companion app. It’s 5.9mm thick and weighs about half a pound, and Sony claims it’ll last around a month on a single charge. Like the larger model, the DPT-CP1 is likely to remain a Japan-only product, and it isn’t really aimed at mainstream consumers. Sony says the price will be “under” 70,000 yen, or about $650, which would make it roughly $100 cheaper than its bigger sibling. It’ll be available in early June.
