 Apple’s education event today is focused on the new $299 iPad, designed as its most “affordable” device with Apple Pencil support. It’s also updating its Pages app to bring a new digital book creation tool to let educators and students make books together, including the use of handwritten notes and drawings. Previously, a similar feature on the Mac was the iBooks Author app. Instead of calling it iBooks Author, however, Apple is now calling it Digital Books. Students can make a book for a group project and these “books” can include photos, videos, or even Apple Pencil illustrations. Users will be able to create books from pre-made templates.
