 The “time well spent” movement that’s sweeping tech may be coming to Facebook. A new feature that was spotted by Jane Manchun Wong (an engineer who’s previously uncovered new features in Instagram by digging through the code) will show users how much time they spend on the social media site. The news was first reported by TechCrunch.

In its current form, the feature will show you how much time you’ve spent on Facebook each day over the last week, along with the average time spent on the site per day. It will also offer you the option to set a daily time limit as well as a link to manage your Facebook notifications. Facebook has confirmed to TechCrunch that the feature is in development, although it would not say when or even if it’ll be launching for all users.
