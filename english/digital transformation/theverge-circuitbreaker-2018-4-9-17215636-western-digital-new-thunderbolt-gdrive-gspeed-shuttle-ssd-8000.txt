 Western Digital has made three external SSDs for video creators dealing with large files. Most of these are business-facing video storage drives, given the steep prices and amount of storage. The three new drives all support high transfer speeds and have huge amounts of storage (up to 16TB). The drives are meant to give video producers faster upload speeds of up to 2800MB/s so they can better deal with large 4K and 8K RAW files, which take up a lot of space and are usually slow to upload. The first one, G-Drive Mobile Pro SSD, lets you edit 8K video at high frame rates and in full resolution. Western Digital claims that with the G-Drive, you can “transfer as much as a terabyte of media in seven minutes or less.” It’s also built for traveling and designed to prevent overheating. The G-Drive Mobile Pro has a Thunderbolt 3 port that lets you edit video while outdoors and can store up to a terabyte of data. The SSD becomes available this summer and costs either $659.95 for 500GB of storage or $1,049.95 for 1TB of storage. Then there’s the G-Drive Pro SSD, which is similar to the Mobile SSD but designed to be used in the workplace. The speed of transfer and the full resolution of video it can handle are the same, but it comes with two Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of one and the ports can be daisy-chained to up to five additional devices. The storage options are 960GB for $1,399.95, 1.92TB ($2,099.95), 3.84TB ($4,099.95), and the massive 7.68TB ($7,599.95). The Pro SSD comes in May. Finally, for those dealing with gargantuan files that exceed 7TB in total, there’s the G-Speed Shuttle SSD that supports HD, 8K, VR, and VFX editing. It has eight removable SSDs and is available this month. The 8TB option costs $5,099,95, and the 16TB option costs $7,599.95.
