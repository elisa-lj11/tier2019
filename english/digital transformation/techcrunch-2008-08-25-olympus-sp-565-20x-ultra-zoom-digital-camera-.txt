  What do you get when you throw in a 20x zoom lens into a smallish package? A peeping tom’s second best friend.  Olympus is doing just that with their new SP-565 ultra zoom point-and-shoot cam. (third new model of the day btw) The camera outfit is simply updating the venerable SP-570UZ with the same 20x zoom lens but shrinking the overall bezel size. The techs still were able to include dual image stabilization, a 2.5-inch LCD screen, and managed updated the face detection to 16 smiling neighbors friends. Olympus also felt that users needed more memory options, and instead of including the near-industry standard SD slot, the SP-565 can utilize a Micro-SD card. The estimated street price should be $399 when the camera hits it in October.
