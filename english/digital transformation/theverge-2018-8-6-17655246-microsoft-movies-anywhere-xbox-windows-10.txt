 Microsoft is joining Disney’s Movies Anywhere service this week. The software giant’s Movies & TV app on Xbox and Windows 10 will support Movies Anywhere, allowing you to access digital movies from services like iTunes, Google Play Movies, Vudu, Amazon Video, and more. This also means any movies purchased using a Microsoft Account on an Xbox or Windows 10 PC will sync to the Movies Anywhere service and be available on other platforms. Disney, Sony, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal, and Warner Bros. are currently supporting Movies Anywhere, so most titles will be supported by the service. Xbox and Windows 10 users can simply link their Microsoft Account to an existing or new Movies Anywhere account to sync purchased movies. Microsoft was one of the last major holdouts of Movies Anywhere, but Xbox and Windows 10 users will be happy to see the company finally support the service. Unfortunately, Movies Anywhere is still limited to just US consumers right now, though. Update August 7th 4:30AM ET: Microsoft has officially announced it’s joining Movies Anywhere.
