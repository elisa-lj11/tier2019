 Zinio, which bills itself as the world’s largest digital newsstand and bookstore, has raised $20 million in new funding according to an SEC filing. Zinio  provides global access to thousands of magazine titles from most major publishers in a variety of languages. The company’s website allows publications to be read online or offline on desktop computers (Windows, Mac OS X and Linux) and mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, WebOS and Android handsets (they just launched their Kindle Fire offering). Originally founded in 2000, Zinio is owned by billionaire entrepreneur David H. Gilmour, with managing director Doug Carlson (who is solely listed on the regulatory filing documents) and Zinio founder and CEO Richard Maggiotto running the business. The company also recently appointed Virendra Vase, a former Jigsaw (now a Salesforce company) executive, as its new COO. Zinio is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in NYC, London, Paris, Barcelona and Taipei. Last we heard Zinio raised funding was way back in 2005, when the company completed a $7 million growth financing round led by North Bridge Ventures and Commonwealth Capital, partly to finance an acquisition. It’s unclear if they or which new investors participated in the recent $20 million funding round, but we’ve contacted the company for more information and will update when we hear back.
