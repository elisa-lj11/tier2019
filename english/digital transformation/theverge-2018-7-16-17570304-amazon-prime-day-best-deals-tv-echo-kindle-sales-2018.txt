 Happy Prime Day 2018! Looking for the best deals? You’ve come to the right place because Prime Day kicks off right now, July 16th at 3PM ET / 12PM PT, and it will offer a veritable landslide of deals for a full 36 hours until 2:59AM ET (July 18th) / 11:59PM PT (July 17th) on Amazon’s website. Amazon does appear to be having some issues with the Prime Day launch: parts of the website down for users around the world. So if you’re not seeing any deals yet, try to be a little patient.  Just like in years past, Amazon will offer two types of deals on Prime Day: regular price cuts, which will become available at various points throughout the 36 hours of the “holiday” but otherwise work as regular Amazon purchases, and Lightning Deals, which will appear for specific times and for specific quantities only. So you’ll want to keep an eye on that deal page if you’re looking for anything specific.  You can also join us here at The Verge. We’ll be sorting, collecting, and highlighting all the best deals for you right on this page, so check back often.
