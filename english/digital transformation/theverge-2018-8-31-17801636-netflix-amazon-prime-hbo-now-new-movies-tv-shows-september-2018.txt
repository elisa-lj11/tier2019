 Summer is over, which means it’s that special time of year when streaming services start loading up on scary movies because Halloween is coming. (To be clear, I mean the holiday, not the David Gordon Green-helmed sequel to John Carpenter’s 1978 classic horror flick — though that’s going to premiere in September at the Toronto International Film Festival, so we can get excited for that as well.) Netflix starts things strong, adding Robert Eggers’ terrifying feature debut The Witch, alongside more pulpy fare like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning and The Most Assassinated Woman in the World. Hold the Dark, the new Jeffrey Wright thriller from Green Room director Jeremy Saulnier will be coming to the service in September, but Netflix is also daring to step outside the bounds of horror, adding Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther and the second season of the Marvel series Iron Fist. (Though, depending on your point of view, the latter could also be considered frightening.) The second season of American Vandal is also arriving, as will Sierra Burgess is a Loser, starring Stranger Things’ Shannon Purser. Amazon Prime will be adding its own selection of horror, including Poltergeist II: The Other Side, Pumpkinhead, the first two Ghostbusters films, and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (egads!). The original Amityville Horror will also be arriving on the service, as will the studio’s new comedy series Forever, starring Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen, and King Lear, starring Anthony Hopkins.  HBO Now has its own new additions for scary season, including the first two Brendan Fraser Mummy films, as well as Tom Cruise’s more recent entry (each have their own unique horrors). There are also a number of films from the Wrong Turn and House of the Dead franchises, as well as Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride. Thankfully, the service also has some non-terrifying programming, including the second season of The Deuce, and Miss Sherlock, a Japanese reinterpretation of the Sherlock Holmes book series set in Tokyo.  We’ve included the full list of titles for all three services below.
