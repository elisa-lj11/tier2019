 Baseball collectibles like cards and bobbleheads are being revamped for the 21st century — on the blockchain. Major League Baseball has announced that it is launching a crypto-based game that runs on the ethereum blockchain later this summer. It’s a crypto-based version of the classic collectibles that’s similar to the most popular blockchain game CryptoKitties, where players can buy and trade cartoon kitten characters with ether. CryptoKitties has already made over $25 million worth of ether, making it a huge success. In the MLB version of the game, people will be able to purchase avatars involving some popular moments in baseball history. Those avatars can then be sold or traded, and users can earn rewards. According to a report from Yahoo Finance, MLB had been looking to create a crypto-based game for quite some time, and the success of CryptoKitties validated the ideas the company already had.  Developers aren’t only targeting people who are already involved in the crypto scene either. They’re looking to build a game that is easy to understand and use for the masses of people who don’t know what the blockchain or ethereum are. Still, developers say there will be a learning curve, and the game will roll out in stages to help new players get accustomed to the concept.
